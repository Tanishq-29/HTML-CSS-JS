Simple HTML tags
There are many tags available in HTML. Here you will learn about common tags that you'll use as a developer.

<!-- Headings -->
Headings allow you to display titles and subtitles on your webpage.
<body>
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
</body>
<!-- The heading size decreases from h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest) -->


<!-- Paragraphs -->
Paragraphs contain text content.
<p>
   This paragraph
   contains a lot of lines
   but they are ignored.
</p>
The following displays in the web browser:
This paragraph contains a lot of lines but they are ignored.

NOTE that putting content on a new line is ignored by the web browser.


<!-- Line Breaks -->
As you've learned, line breaks in the paragraph tag line are ignored by HTML. Instead, they must be specified using the <br> tag. The <br> tag does not need a closing tag.

<p>
   This paragraph<br>
   contains a lot of lines<br>
   and they are displayed.
</p>
The following displays in the web browser: 
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
but they are ignored.
 
<!-- Strong -->
Strong tags can be used to indicate that a range of text has importance.
<p>
   No matter how much the dog barks: <strong>don't feed him chocolate</strong>.
</p>
The following displays in the web browser: 
No matter how much the dog barks: *don't feed him chocolate*.

<!-- Bold -->
Bold tags can be used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text.
<p>
   The primary colors are <b>red</b>, <b>yellow</b> and <b>blue</b>.
</p>
The following displays in the web browser: 
The primary colors are *red*,*yellow* and *blue*.

Bold tags should be used to draw attention but not to indicate that something is more important.
Consider the following example:
The three core technologies of the Internet are <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>.


<!-- Emphasis -->
Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
<p>
   Wake up <em>now</em>!
</p>
The following displays in the web browser: 
Wake up _now_!


<!-- Italics -->
Italics tags can be used to offset a range of text.
<p>
   The term <i>HTML</i> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
</p>
The following displays in the web browser: 
The term _HTML_ stands for HyperText Markup Language.

<!-- Emphasis vs. Italics -->
By default both tags will have the same visual effect in the web browser. 
The only difference is the meaning.
Emphasis tags stress the text contained in them. Let's explore the following example:

I <em>really</em> want ice cream.

Italics represent off-set text and should be used for technical terms, titles, a thought or a phrase from another language
For example:
My favourite book is <i>Dracula</i>.


Screen readers will not announce any difference if an italics tag is used.

<!-- Lists -->
You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.

Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag, for example:

<ul>
   <li>Tea</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

This displays in the web browser as:
<!-- bullet -->Tea
<!-- bullet -->Sugar
<!-- bullet -->Milk

Lists can also be ordered using the <ol> tag. Again, list items are specified using the <li> tag.

<ol>
   <li>Rocky I</li>
   <li>Rocky II</li>
   <li>Rocky III</li>
</ol>
This displays as the following in the web browser.
1. Rocky I
2. Rocky II
3. Rocky III


<!-- Div tags -->
A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document.
It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.
The following example shows a <div> element that contains a paragraph element:

<div>
   <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
</div>
This displays as the following in the web browser.
*This is a paragraph inside a div* 
It can be nested inside other elements, for example:

<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside a div that's inside another div</p>
   </div>
</div>
This displays in the web browser as:
*This is a paragraph inside a div that's inside another div*

As mentioned, the div has no impact on content unless it is styled by CSS. 
Let's add a small CSS-rule that styles all divs on the page.
Don't worry about the meaning of the CSS just yet, you'll explore CSS further in a later lesson. 
In summary, you're applying a rule that adds a border and some visual spacing to the element.

<style>
   div {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 2px;/*space between text and border*/   
   }
</style>
<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside stylized divs</p>
   </div>
</div>
This displays in the web browser as:
*This is a paragraph inside stylized divs* (with a border around it)
Div elements are an important part of building webpages. 
More advanced usage of div elements will be explored in another course.

<!-- Comments -->
If you want to leave a comment in the code for other developers, it can be added as:
<!-- This is a comment --> 
The comment will not be displayed in the web browser.


<!-- Anchor tag -->
Anchor tags are used to create hyperlinks.
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
<p>
   Visit <a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a> for more information.
</p>
This displays in the web browser as:
Visit Example for more information.<!-- On clicking Example, the user will be taken to https://www.example.com. -->


<!-- Image tag -->
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in a webpage.
The src attribute specifies the path to the image.
The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
This displays the image located at image.jpg. If the image cannot be displayed, the text "A description of the image" will be shown instead.
<!-- Note that the img tag does not require a closing tag. -->

<!-- Tables -->
Tables are used to display data in a tabular format.
A table is defined using the <table> tag.
Each row is defined using the <tr> tag.
Table headers are defined using the <th> tag.
Table data is defined using the <td> tag.
<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Data 3</td>
      <td>Data 4</td> 
   </tr>
</table>

<!--Forms-->
Forms are used to collect user input.
A form is defined using the <form> tag.
<form action="/submit" method="post">
   <label for="name">Name:</label>
   <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
   <label for="email">Email:</label>
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
This creates a form with two input fields (name and email) and a submit button.
