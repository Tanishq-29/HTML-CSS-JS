        <b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field[<sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics,
        <mark>scientific computing</mark>, scientific methods, <del>processing</del>, scientific visualization,
        algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured
        data.<sup>[2]</sup><br><br>

        Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences,
        information technology, and medicine).<sup>[3]</sup> Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a
        science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a
        profession.<sup>[4]</sup><br><br>
        Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to
        "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.<sup>[5]</sup> It uses techniques and theories drawn from
        many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain
        knowledge.<sup>[6]</sup> However, data science is different from computer science and information science.
        Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical,
        computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the
        impact of information technology" and the data deluge.<sup>[7][8]</sup>
